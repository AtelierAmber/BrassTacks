gyroscope=Uses the precession of a spinning flywheel to sense orientation and stabilize flight.
skyseeker-armature=Huge mechanism to point heavy machinery like telescopes or artillery at specific points in the sky with a high degree of precision.

airtight-seal-vitalic=Using vitalic epoxy to produce more effective airtight seals.

brasstacks-starting-items=Start with brass
brasstacks-experimental-intermediates=Hard mode
brasstacks-solder-absorption=Solder absorption
brasstacks-gyro-override=Override BZ gyroscope (hard mode only)
brasstacks-se-maintenance=Enable Space Exploration maintenance recipes

brasstacks-classic-icons=Use old item icons

[mod-setting-description]
brasstacks-starting-items=Brass production without initial automation = pain, initial automation without brass = impossible. Ergo, start with a free stack of brass. Only applies to freeplay mode.
brasstacks-experimental-intermediates=Enable numerous extra intermediates: flywheels, articulated mechanisms, galvanized steel plates, hardened hulls, complex joints, gearboxes, advanced gearboxes, gyroscopes. Skyseeker armatures with Space Exploration. Elite gearboxes with Krastorio. Industrial drill heads with BZ tungsten and diamonds. Many of these are complex and/or expensive, relative to the vanilla balance.
brasstacks-solder-absorption=Requires BZ tin. Adds solder to bolted flanges, removes solder from recipes where it is used to represent pipe connections (chemical plants, tanks, etc.) This serves to reduce the number of ingredients in complex recipes. Probably not balanced.
brasstacks-gyro-override=Hard Mode adds a gyroscope. The BZ silicon gyroscope takes precedence if available. Enable this to force use the Brass Tacks recipe instead (which is more expensive)
brasstacks-se-maintenance=If enabled alongside Space Exploration and Hard Mode, SE gravimetrics facilities handling arcospheres will need replacement gyroscopes, pulverizers crushing iridite will sometimes need replacement mechanisms, and telescopes will sometimes need replacement skyseeker armatures.

brasstacks-classic-icons=Use the original vector-art-based items instead of the 3d-rendered ones created by Galdoc.
